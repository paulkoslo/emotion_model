# Emotion Analyzer Web App Todo List

- [X] **DONE** 001: Clarify user requirements
- [X] **DONE** 002: Scaffold Flask backend and React frontend
- [X] **DONE** 003: Implement voice and text input frontend
    - [X] Create basic HTML structure for input elements (text bar, microphone button) and output display areas.
    - [X] Add JavaScript to handle text input.
    - [X] Add JavaScript to handle microphone button click (initiate voice recording).
    - [X] Implement frontend logic to send input (text or voice data) to the backend API (mocked).
    - [X] Implement frontend logic to receive and display predictions (overall sentiment, specific emotion, probability graph) (mocked).
- [X] **DONE** 004: Add API endpoint for model prediction in Flask backend
    - [X] Define a Flask route (e.g., `/api/predict`).
    - [X] Implement logic to receive text or audio data (multipart/form-data).
    - [X] Install `openai-whisper` and `torch`.
    - [X] Integrate Whisper for voice-to-text (using 'base' model).
    - [X] Include placeholder for Keras model inference.
    - [X] Prepare to return emotion predictions (overall and specific) and probabilities.
- [X] **DONE** 005: Integrate emotion mapping logic
    - [X] Define the mapping from 28 specific emotions to positive/neutral/negative in the backend.
    - [X] Apply this mapping to the Keras model's output.
- [X] **DONE** 006: Prepare Keras model integration placeholder
    - [X] Review "Code Paul.ipynb" for the tokenizer function.
    - [X] Clearly mark the section in the backend code where the user's Keras model and tokenizer should be inserted.
    - [X] Ensure the placeholder function accepts text and internally handles tokenization (or provides a clear spot for it) and model prediction, returning emotion probabilities.
- [X] **DONE** 007: Validate functionality and user experience
    - [X] Update frontend to call the actual backend API.
    - [X] Build the React frontend for production.
    - [X] Start the Flask backend server.
    - [X] Expose backend port for testing.
    - [X] Test text input and prediction display with backend.
    - [X] Test voice input and prediction display with backend (microphone access error expected in sandbox).
    - [X] Test the emotion probability graph display with backend data.
    - [X] Verify error handling and UI responsiveness.
    - [X] Ensure the UI is user-friendly.
- [ ] 008: Report and provide app to user
    - [ ] Package the frontend and backend code.
    - [ ] Provide instructions for running the application locally (npm for frontend, Python for backend).
    - [ ] Optionally, deploy to a temporary URL if requested and feasible.
